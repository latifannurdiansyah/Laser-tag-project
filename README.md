# Laser-tag-project
This project is a laser tag game system consisting of three main devices, namely weapons, helmets, and vests. These three devices are integrated to detect shots, process data, and send game results to the server in real time.  The system begins by activating all devices. Once the system is ready, players can shoot by pressing the push button on the gun. When the button is pressed, the infrared (IR) transmitter on the gun emits an infrared signal containing the shooter's ID data. This signal is directed at the opponent and can be received by the opponent's helmet or vest.  If the infrared signal is received by the helmet, the system will first check for protocol compliance using the NEC protocol. If the signal complies with the specified protocol, the helmet will read the shooter's ID data and send it to the vest using ESP-NOW communication. Next, the vest will forward the data to the LoRa Gateway via the LoRa network. However, if the received signal does not comply with the NEC protocol, the shot is considered invalid or missed.  If the infrared signal is received directly by the vest, the process is almost the same. The vest will verify the signal's compliance with the NEC protocol. If valid, the vest will read the shooter's ID data and add information about the location and time of the shot. The complete data is then sent to LoRa.  Translated with DeepL.com (free version)
